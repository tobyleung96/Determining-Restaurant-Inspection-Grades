# Determining NYC Restaurant Inspection Grades

## Abstract: 
NYC is home to over 25,000 restaurants spread across a diverse range of cuisines and locations. However, one constant among them is that they must all attain a sanitary inspection grade in order to lawfully operate. There are many ways to lose valuable points that eventually risk a lower inspection grade, therefore, this project aims to examine the qualities that commonly lead to point deductions. In other words, this project will develop a tool that predicts restaurant inspection grades using the input of geographic, economic, and real estate data.
